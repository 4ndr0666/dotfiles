# This file configures systemd-oomd, a userspace out-of-memory killer
# that makes use of cgroupv2 features to detect and handle OOM situations
# on a system-wide level.

# To activate these settings, save this file as /etc/systemd/oomd.conf or
# create a drop-in file in /etc/systemd/oomd.conf.d/

[OOM]
# Enable or disable systemd-oomd's management of swap space.
# When swap usage reaches this threshold, systemd-oomd will take action.
SwapUsedLimit=90%

# Define a memory pressure limit for a cgroup. If this limit is breached for
# the specified duration, systemd-oomd will kill one or more processes in the cgroup.
DefaultMemoryPressureLimit=60%

# Duration for which the memory pressure limit must be exceeded before systemd-oomd intervenes.
DefaultMemoryPressureDurationSec=30s

# In addition to the default settings, you can define specific rules for certain slices or scopes.
# For instance, to protect important services from being killed, set higher thresholds or exclude them.

[Slice:system.slice]
# Lower priority for system services; more resistant to OOM killing
MemoryPressureLimit=10%
MemoryPressureDurationSec=1min

[Slice:user.slice]
# Higher sensitivity for user slice to keep user applications responsive
MemoryPressureLimit=70%
MemoryPressureDurationSec=15s

[Scope:session-*.scope]
# Specific settings for user sessions
MemoryPressureLimit=80%
MemoryPressureDurationSec=20s
