### **Cheat Sheet for `xdg-settings`**

#### **Overview**:
`xdg-settings` is a tool that allows desktop environments to configure certain key settings, such as the default web browser, URL scheme handlers, and proxy settings. It’s particularly useful for applications that do not natively integrate with the desktop environment.

---

### **Syntax**:
```bash
xdg-settings { get | check | set } {property} [subproperty] [value]
```

- **`get`**: Retrieve the value of a setting.
- **`check`**: Verify whether a setting exists or is properly configured.
- **`set`**: Modify or assign a value to a setting.

---

### **Options**:
- `--help`: Show help with command usage information.
- `--list`: List all properties that can be retrieved, checked, or set by `xdg-settings`.
- `--manual`: Display the manual page for `xdg-settings`.
- `--version`: Show the version of the `xdg-utils` package.

---

### **Common Use Cases and Examples**

#### 1. **Managing Default Applications**:
Most desktop environments allow users to define default applications for tasks such as opening web pages, emails, or certain file types. `xdg-settings` helps manage these defaults.

---

#### **Get the Default Web Browser**:
To retrieve the current default web browser, use:
```bash
xdg-settings get default-web-browser
```
**Example Output**:
```
firefox.desktop
```
This indicates that `Firefox` is set as the default browser.

---

#### **Set the Default Web Browser**:
To change the default web browser, you can specify the `.desktop` file of the application you want:
```bash
xdg-settings set default-web-browser google-chrome.desktop
```
This command will set `Google Chrome` as the default web browser.

---

#### **Verify the Default Browser**:
To check if the default web browser is set correctly:
```bash
xdg-settings check default-web-browser
```
If properly configured, this command will return an exit status of 0, which means success.

---

#### 2. **Managing URL Scheme Handlers**:
Applications can register as handlers for specific URL schemes like `mailto`, `http`, or `ftp`. You can configure these handlers using `xdg-settings`.

---

#### **Get the Handler for `mailto` URLs**:
```bash
xdg-settings get default-url-scheme-handler mailto
```
**Example Output**:
```
thunderbird.desktop
```
This output shows that `Thunderbird` is the default handler for `mailto` URLs.

---

#### **Set the Handler for `mailto` URLs**:
```bash
xdg-settings set default-url-scheme-handler mailto evolution.desktop
```
This will set `Evolution` as the default email client for handling `mailto` URLs.

---

#### **Get the Handler for Web Pages (HTTP)**:
You can also configure the handler for `http` or `https` URLs:
```bash
xdg-settings get default-url-scheme-handler https
```
**Example Output**:
```
firefox.desktop
```

---

#### **Set the Handler for HTTP URLs**:
```bash
xdg-settings set default-url-scheme-handler http google-chrome.desktop
```
This will set `Google Chrome` as the default application for opening web links.

---

#### 3. **Proxy Settings**:
While `xdg-settings` does not directly manage proxy settings on all desktop environments, some may integrate proxy configurations. Usually, a desktop environment-specific tool like GNOME's dconf or KDE's system settings are used for this.

---

### **Working with Properties**:

#### **Available Properties**:
You can get a list of all properties managed by `xdg-settings` by running:
```bash
xdg-settings --list
```
This will show properties like `default-web-browser`, `default-url-scheme-handler`, and others specific to your desktop environment.

---

### **Exit Codes**:
The exit codes from `xdg-settings` provide valuable feedback about the success or failure of the operation.

- **0**: Operation successful.
- **1**: Syntax error in the command.
- **2**: One of the files (e.g., a `.desktop` file) specified did not exist.
- **3**: Required tool not found (e.g., a missing dependency).
- **4**: The action itself failed (e.g., an unsupported property or an invalid value).

---

### **Advanced Examples and Real-World Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Automatically Set the Default Browser Based on User Preferences**:
You have a script that determines a user’s preferred browser based on an environment variable. You can dynamically set this preference using:
```bash
if [ "$PREFERRED_BROWSER" = "chrome" ]; then
    xdg-settings set default-web-browser google-chrome.desktop
else
    xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop
fi
```
This will allow you to automatically configure the default browser based on the user's preference stored in an environment variable.

---

#### **Scenario 2: Ensure All Email Links Open in a Specific Email Client**:
If you’re managing multiple systems and need to enforce `Thunderbird` as the email client across them, use:
```bash
xdg-settings set default-url-scheme-handler mailto thunderbird.desktop
```
You can then verify the setting by checking:
```bash
xdg-settings get default-url-scheme-handler mailto
```

---

#### **Scenario 3: Check if a Setting Exists Before Applying a Change**:
Before applying a change to a handler, you may want to ensure the setting exists. For example, check if `http` handler is set:
```bash
if xdg-settings check default-url-scheme-handler http; then
    echo "Handler is properly configured"
else
    echo "Handler is not set"
fi
```

---

### **Cross-Desktop Considerations**:
- **GNOME**: Some `xdg-settings` properties might be overridden by GNOME’s `dconf` tool, so changes via `xdg-settings` may not reflect immediately if `dconf` is in use.
- **KDE**: Similarly, in KDE environments, `xdg-settings` may not work as expected for some properties, as KDE relies on its own configuration systems (`kcmshell`).

---

### **Further Tips**:

- Ensure that `.desktop` files exist in `/usr/share/applications/` or `~/.local/share/applications/` before using them in `xdg-settings`.
- If you’re scripting across multiple users, use `xdg-settings` in conjunction with other environment-specific tools to ensure consistent behavior.
