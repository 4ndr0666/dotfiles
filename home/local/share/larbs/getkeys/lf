# --- // Notes // ========
- The `Ebf` and `Ebd` commands, for example, are sequential key presses, not simultaneous. First, press `E`, release it, then press `b`, and finally press `f`.
- The `C` in keybindings like `Cvv` stands for the Control key. These are chords, meaning you first press and hold the Control key, then press the subsequent keys in sequence.
