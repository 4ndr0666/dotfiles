# SwapUsedLimit: Set this slightly above the earlyoom swap threshold.
# Earlyoom acts at 35%, so set oomd to act at 40% to avoid conflicts.
SwapUsedLimit=50%

# DefaultMemoryPressureLimit: Set this higher than earlyoom's memory threshold.
# Earlyoom acts at 35%, so set oomd to act at 45% to handle more severe situations.
DefaultMemoryPressureLimit=45%

# DefaultMemoryPressureDurationSec: Keep this at 10 seconds to allow oomd to
# act only after sustained memory pressure, ensuring it complements earlyoom.
DefaultMemoryPressureDurationSec=10s
